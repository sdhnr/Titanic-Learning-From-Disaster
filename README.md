# Titanic Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository houses a machine learning project focused on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic. The project is designed to showcase various aspects of the machine learning workflow, from data exploration and preprocessing to model building and evaluation. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn more about machine learning or an experienced data scientist, you'll find valuable insights and code examples in this repository.

## Project Details
In this project, we delve into the historic Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, and, most importantly, survival outcomes. Our primary objective is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the provided features. We explore various algorithms and techniques to achieve the best possible predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is derived from the Kaggle "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. It consists of two primary CSV files:

- `train.csv`: The training dataset with passenger information and known survival labels.
- `test.csv`: The testing dataset for which survival labels need to be predicted.

You can access and download the dataset from the [Kaggle Titanic competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). Once downloaded, place the CSV files in the `data/` directory of this repository.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
